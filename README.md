## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB.

## Optimizations
Implemented the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to structure the application efficiently. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability by separating concerns and organizing code into distinct layers for better management and scalability.

## Lessons Learned
Gained hands-on experience with full-stack development by working with front-end and back-end technologies. Learned effective database management practices with MongoDB by understanding how to design data structures, perform efficient queries, and manage collections.
